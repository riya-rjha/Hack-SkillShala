Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return the next state.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\nConstraints:\n`m == board.length`\n`n == board[i].length`\n`1 <= m, n <= 25`\n`board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.\n\nFollow up:\nCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\n\nIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border).

        "description": "Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.\n\nThe iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even `i`, `A[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i+1]` is repeated in the sequence.\n\nThe iterator supports one function: `next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n` elements (`n >= 1`) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.\n\nFor example, we start with `A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]`, which is a run-length encoding of the sequence `[8,8,8,5,5]`.  This is because the sequence can be read as \"three eights, zero nines, two fives\".\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [\"RLEIterator\",\"next\",\"next\",\"next\",\"next\"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]\nOutput: [null,8,8,5,-1]\nExplanation: \nRLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).\n\nThis maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].\n\nRLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:\n.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].\n\n.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].\n\n.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].\n\n.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,\nbut the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.\n\nNote:\n`0 <= A.length <= 1000`\n`A.length` is an even integer.\n\n`0 <= A[i] <= 10^9`\nThere are at most `1000` calls to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` per test case.\n\nEach call to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` will have `1 <= n <= 10^9`.",

(see example 4)\n\nExample 1:\nInput: rains = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [-1,-1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]\nAfter the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]\nThere's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]\nOutput: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]\nAfter the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.\n\nAfter the fifth day, full lakes are [2].\n\nAfter the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].\n\nIt is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.\n\nAfter that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]\nOutput: [-1,69,1,1,-1]\nExplanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9\n\nExample 5:\nInput: rains = [10,20,20]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= rains.length <= 105`\n`0 <= rains[i] <= 109`",

        "description": "Given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`, find the shortest completing word in `words`.\n\nA completing word is a word that contains all the letters in `licensePlate`. Ignore numbers and spaces in `licensePlate`, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in `licensePlate`, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.\n\nFor example, if `licensePlate`` = \"aBc 12c\"`, then it contains letters `'a'`, `'b'` (ignoring case), and `'c'` twice. Possible completing words are `\"abccdef\"`, `\"caaacab\"`, and `\"cbca\"`.\n\nReturn the shortest completing word in `words`. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in `words`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: licensePlate = \"1s3 PSt\", words = [\"step\",\"steps\",\"stripe\",\"stepple\"]\nOutput: \"steps\"\nExplanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.\n\n\"step\" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.\n\n\"steps\" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.\n\n\"stripe\" is missing an 's'.\n\n\"stepple\" is missing an 's'.\n\nSince \"steps\" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: licensePlate = \"1s3 456\", words = [\"looks\",\"pest\",\"stew\",\"show\"]\nOutput: \"pest\"\nExplanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these \"pest\", \"stew\", and \"show\" are shortest. The answer is \"pest\" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: licensePlate = \"Ah71752\", words = [\"suggest\",\"letter\",\"of\",\"husband\",\"easy\",\"education\",\"drug\",\"prevent\",\"writer\",\"old\"]\nOutput: \"husband\"\n\nExample 4:\nInput: licensePlate = \"OgEu755\", words = [\"enough\",\"these\",\"play\",\"wide\",\"wonder\",\"box\",\"arrive\",\"money\",\"tax\",\"thus\"]\nOutput: \"enough\"\n\nExample 5:\nInput: licensePlate = \"iMSlpe4\", words = [\"claim\",\"consumer\",\"student\",\"camera\",\"public\",\"never\",\"wonder\",\"simple\",\"thought\",\"use\"]\nOutput: \"simple\"\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= licensePlate.length <= 7`\n`licensePlate` contains digits, letters (uppercase or lowercase), or space `' '`.\n\n`1 <= words.length <= 1000`\n`1 <= words[i].length <= 15`\n`words[i]` consists of lower case English letters.",

When we visit a domain like \"discuss.leetcode.com\", we will also visit the parent domains \"leetcode.com\" and \"com\" implicitly.\n\nNow, call a \"count-paired domain\" to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be \"9001 discuss.leetcode.com\".\n\nWe are given a list `cpdomains` of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \n[\"9001 discuss.leetcode.com\"]\nOutput: \n[\"9001 discuss.leetcode.com\", \"9001 leetcode.com\", \"9001 com\"]\nExplanation: \nWe only have one website domain: \"discuss.leetcode.com\". As discussed above, the subdomain \"leetcode.com\" and \"com\" will also be visited.

Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n\nRead in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached.

Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n\nIf the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range.

Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).\n\n- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's\n  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.\n\n- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its\n  closest valid ancestor.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [5,6,10,2,3,6,15], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]\nOutput: [-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1]\n\nConstraints:\n`nums.length == n`\n`1 <= nums[i] <= 50`\n`1 <= n <= 105`\n`edges.length == n - 1`\n`edges[j].length == 2`\n`0 <= uj, vj < n`\n`uj != vj`",

        "description": "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program `source` is an array where `source[i]` is the `i`-th line of the source code.  This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `\\n`.\n\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\nThe string `//` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n\nThe string `/*` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `*/` should be ignored.  (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string `/*/` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string `//` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string `/*` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, `source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\"` will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `/*` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.  Please see the examples below for details.\n\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \nsource = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\nThe line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nOutput: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\nThe line by line code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\nExplanation: \nThe string `/*` denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string `//` denotes line 4 as comments.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \nsource = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\nOutput: [\"ab\"]\nExplanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\nNote:\nThe length of `source` is in the range `[1, 100]`.\n\nThe length of `source[i]` is in the range `[0, 80]`.\n\nEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\n\nThere are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.",

        "title": "tag validator",
        "description": "Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\nThe code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n\nA valid `TAG_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is invalid.\n\nA valid `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is invalid.\n\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n\nA `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).\n\nThe cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`. \n`CDATA_CONTENT` may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. \n\nValid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.\n\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\n\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\n\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\n\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\n\nInvalid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nNote:\nFor simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain `letters`, `digits`, `'<'`,`'>'`,`'/'`,`'!'`,`'['`,`']'` and `' '`.",

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\nA let-expression takes the form `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)`, where `let` is always the string `\"let\"`, then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression `expr`.\n\nAn add-expression takes the form `(add e1 e2)` where `add` is always the string `\"add\"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n\nA mult-expression takes the form `(mult e1 e2)` where `mult` is always the string `\"mult\"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", or \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\nFinally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.\n\n\nEvaluation Examples:\nInput: (add 1 2)\nOutput: 3\nInput: (mult 3 (add 2 3))\nOutput: 15\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x 5))\nOutput: 10\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\n\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\nInput: (let x 3 x 2 x)\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\nInput: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\n\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\nInput: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context\nof the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.\n\nInput: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) \nOutput 4\nExplanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.\n\nNote:\nThe given string `expression` is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.

For example, to compress the string `\"aabccc\"` we replace `\"aa\"` by `\"a2\"` and replace `\"ccc\"` by `\"c3\"`. Thus the compressed string becomes `\"a2bc3\"`.\n\nNotice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.\n\nGiven a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.\n\nRick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.\n\nGiven the integer array `position` and the integer `m`.

You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.\n\nInitially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.\n\nAt the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:\nYou can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].\n\nIf the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step.

However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.\n\nYou are given an array `boxes`, where `boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti]`, and three integers `portsCount`, `maxBoxes`, and `maxWeight`.\n\n`ports​​i` is the port where you need to deliver the `ith` box and `weightsi` is the weight of the `ith` box.\n\n`portsCount` is the number of ports.\n\n`maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.\n\nThe boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:\nThe ship will take some number of boxes from the `boxes` queue, not violating the `maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` constraints.\n\nFor each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.\n\nThe ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.\n\nThe ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.\n\nReturn the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: \n- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 4.\n\nNote that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: \n- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:\n- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: boxes = [[2,4],[2,5],[3,1],[3,2],[3,7],[3,1],[4,4],[1,3],[5,2]], portsCount = 5, maxBoxes = 5, maxWeight = 7\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:\n- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the second box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the sixth and seventh boxes, goes to port 3, then port 4, then storage. 3 trips. \n- The ship takes the eighth and ninth boxes, goes to port 1, then port 5, then storage. 3 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= boxes.length <= 105`\n`1 <= portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight <= 105`\n`1 <= ports​​i <= portsCount`\n`1 <= weightsi <= maxWeight`",

You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.\n\nInitially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.\n\nAt the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:\nYou can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].\n\nIf the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.\n\n\nExample:\nInput: ring = \"godding\", key = \"gd\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nFor the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. \nFor the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring \"godding\" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become \"ddinggo\".\n\nAlso, we need 1 more step for spelling.\n\nSo the final output is 4.\n\nNote:\nLength of both ring and key will be in range 1 to 100.\n\nThere are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.\n\nIt's guaranteed that string key could always be spelled by rotating the string ring.",

Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.\n\nFunction calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n\nYou are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `\"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\"`. For example, `\"0:start:3\"` means a function call with function ID `0` started at the beginning of timestamp `3`, and `\"1:end:2\"` means a function call with function ID `1` ended at the end of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the exclusive time is `2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the `ith` index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID `i`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\nOutput: [3,4]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\n\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\n\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [8]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\n\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [7,1]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\n\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\n\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\n\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:7\",\"1:end:7\",\"0:end:8\"]\nOutput: [8,1]\n\nExample 5:\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:end:0\"]\nOutput: [1]\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= n <= 100`\n`1 <= logs.length <= 500`\n`0 <= function_id < n`\n`0 <= timestamp <= 109`\nNo two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\nNo two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\nEach function has an `\"end\"` log for each `\"start\"` log.",

        "description": "Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\nThe code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n\nA valid `TAG_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is invalid.\n\nA valid `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is invalid.\n\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n\nA `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).\n\nThe cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`. \n`CDATA_CONTENT` may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. \n\nValid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.\n\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\n\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\n\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\n\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\n\nInvalid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nNote:\nFor simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain `letters`, `digits`, `'<'`,`'>'`,`'/'`,`'!'`,`'['`,`']'` and `' '`.",

The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\n\nYou may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:\nDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.\n\nDuring even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.\n\nIt may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\n\nReturn the number of good starting indices.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\n\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\n\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\n\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].\n\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].\n\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\n\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\n\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104`\n`0 <= arr[i] < 105`",

One optimal set of moves is:\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)\nThere are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:\n- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)\nThere are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: a = 1, b = 8, c = 8\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.\n\nAfter that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= a, b, c <= 105`",

        "description": "You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei]` denotes that `amounti` orders have been placed of type `orderTypei` at the price `pricei`. The `orderTypei` is:\n`0` if it is a batch of `buy` orders, or\n`1` if it is a batch of `sell` orders.\n\nNote that `orders[i]` represents a batch of `amounti` independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by `orders[i]` will be placed before all orders represented by `orders[i+1]` for all valid `i`.\n\nThere is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:\nIf the order is a `buy` order, you look at the `sell` order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that `sell` order's price is smaller than or equal to the current `buy` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `sell` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `buy` order is added to the backlog.\n\nVice versa, if the order is a `sell` order, you look at the `buy` order with the largest price in the backlog. If that `buy` order's price is larger than or equal to the current `sell` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `buy` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `sell` order is added to the backlog.\n\nReturn the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\n- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\n\n- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.\n\nFinally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]\nOutput: 999999984\nExplanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\n- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\n\n- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.\n\nFinally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5.

        "description": "You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you `runningCost` dollars.\n\nYou are given an array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of new customers arriving just before the `ith` rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel `i` times before the `customers[i]` customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.\n\nYou can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.\n\nReturn the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit.

        "description": "Given a string `s` of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of `s` that meet the following conditions:\nThe substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings `s[i..j]` and `s[k..l]`, either `j < k` or `i > l` is true.\n\nA substring that contains a certain character `c` must also contain all occurrences of `c`.\n\nFind the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.\n\nNotice that you can return the substrings in any order.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"adefaddaccc\"\nOutput: [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"]\nExplanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:\n[\n  \"adefaddaccc\"\n  \"adefadda\",\n  \"ef\",\n  \"e\",\n  \"f\",\n  \"ccc\",\n]\nIf we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose \"adefadda\", we are left with \"ccc\" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose \"ef\" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"abbaccd\"\nOutput: [\"d\",\"bb\",\"cc\"]\nExplanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [\"d\",\"abba\",\"cc\"] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= s.length <= 10^5`\n`s` contains only lowercase English letters.",

After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).\n\nYou are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `ith` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants.

        "description": "There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node `0`.\n\nTo represent this tree, you are given an integer array `nums` and a 2D array `edges`. Each `nums[i]` represents the `ith` node's value, and each `edges[j] = [uj, vj]` represents an edge between nodes `uj` and `vj` in the tree.\n\nTwo values `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x, y) == 1` where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.\n\nAn ancestor of a node `i` is any other node on the shortest path from node `i` to the root. A node is not considered an ancestor of itself.\n\nReturn an array `ans` of size `n`, where `ans[i]` is the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are coprime, or `-1` if there is no such ancestor.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,3,3,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]\nOutput: [-1,0,0,1]\nExplanation: In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.\n\n- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.\n\n- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0. Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).\n\n- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's\n  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.\n\n- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its\n  closest valid ancestor.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [5,6,10,2,3,6,15], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]\nOutput: [-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1]\n\nConstraints:\n`nums.length == n`\n`1 <= nums[i] <= 50`\n`1 <= n <= 105`\n`edges.length == n - 1`\n`edges[j].length == 2`\n`0 <= uj, vj < n`\n`uj != vj`",

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.\n\nFor example: we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, `add` , `erase` and `search `can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\n\nTo be specific, your design should include these functions:\n`bool search(int target)` : Return whether the `target` exists in the Skiplist or not.\n\n`void add(int num)`: Insert a value into the SkipList. \n`bool erase(int num)`: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\nSee more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n\nExample:\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0);   // return false.\n\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1);   // return true.\n\nskiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.\n\nskiplist.erase(1);    // return true.\n\nskiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`0 <= num, target <= 20000`\nAt most `50000` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.",

Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.\n\nThe geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:\n`lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.\n\n`righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.\n\n`heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.\n\nYou may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.\n\nThe skyline should be represented as a list of \"key points\" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends.

If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.\n\nIt may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\n\nReturn the number of good starting indices.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\n\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\n\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\n\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].\n\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].\n\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\n\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\n\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104`\n`0 <= arr[i] < 105`",
